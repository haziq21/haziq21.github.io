        I&rsquo;m a strong believer of project-based learning, and so I&rsquo;ve
        worked on some projects over the years &mdash; here are a few of them.
        In the interest of learning, I tend to do more things from scratch
        instead of using high-level libraries or all-in-one platforms.
